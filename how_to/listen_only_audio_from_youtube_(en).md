I will use [mpv](https://mpv.io/) for the purpose. It's a media player which is opensource and cross platform. It has also a command line interface that I will use for my purpose. As I want to listen only audio, I don't need a GUI

Example from run-time:
```
onurs-mbp:~ onuryilmaz$ mpv --no-video https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zfXBNQMj2SE
Playing: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zfXBNQMj2SE
 (+) Audio --aid=1 --alang=eng (*) (opus)
AO: [coreaudio] 48000Hz stereo 2ch floatp
A: 00:03:45 / 00:03:45 (99%) Cache:  0s+0KB


Exiting... (End of file)
