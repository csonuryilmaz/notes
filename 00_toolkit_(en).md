## Toolkit

This documentation contains some tools that I have been using as a developer on my working and leisure hours. I tried to categorize them according to functionality that I used more. So, the list is subjective. During my career I used lots of tools which doesn't exist anymore. To keep the list short and up-to-date, I listed only the tools currently I'm using.
