### notes

This repository contains some documents, notes and how-to files from my works and readings. Also I plan to keep my development and software related bookmarks under this repository. 

Why I share? Currently I don't have a blog or website and I can't spare some time to those activities. But on the other hand I'm:
* reading technical and non-technical books
* watching and listening some technical stuff
* attending conferences, meetups, workshops as much as possible
* working on some experimental issues in my free times
* experimenting new software and tools

and most importantly I take written notes from those activites. By keeping them online, I can share with little effort and community can benefit from them.

Most of them are in English, but some of them are in Turkish. File name contains the document's content language in ISO 639-1 (two-letter codes) standard. So (tr) means the content is in Turkish and (en) means the content is in English.

All feedbacks and contributions are wellcome. Happy learning! :coffee:
