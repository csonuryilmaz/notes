### notes

This repository contains some documents, notes and how-to files from my works and readings. Also I plan to keep my development and software related bookmarks under this repository. 

Why I share? Currently I don't have a blog or website and I can't spare some time to those activities. But on the other hand I'm:
* reading technical books
* watching and listening some technical stuff
* attending conferences, meetups, workshops as much as possible
* working on some experimental issues in my free times
* experimenting new software and tools

and most importantly I take written notes from those activites. By keeping them online, I can share with little effort and community can benefit from them.

All feedbacks and contributions are wellcome. Happy learning!
